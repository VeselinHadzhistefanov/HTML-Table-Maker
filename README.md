Basic stack of components making up the most simple form able to contain both a chat and express design ideas centered around simplicity and stripping of details. Serves best any app aiming at quick communication patterns and user-flow with the help of user prompts and command-line interface interactions.

The tool works by prompting the user to enter data row by row and requesting them to provide names of columns as headings. This allows the user to enter data using copy and paste while, maintaining fluid control of the table-building by being able to add more rows on the go. To better control the process the user is prompted at each step, whether they would like to enter more data and the data is entered into the table. The process can terminate with the -r command (to be decided). -rm prvides mark-up data for copy and pasting into mark-up files. -rs provides a ready-to-use file containing all the data put in a table.
